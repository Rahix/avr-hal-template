`avr-hal-template`
==================
[`cargo-generate`] template for jumpstarting projects on common AVR
microcontroller boards.  This template supports the following hardware at this
time:

 - Arduino Leonardo
 - Arduino Mega 2560
 - Arduino Nano
 - Arduino Nano New Bootloader (Manufactured after January 2018)
 - Arduino Uno
 - SparkFun ProMicro
 - Adafruit Trinket
 - Adafruit Trinket Pro

## Usage
If you don't have them already, install [`cargo-generate`] and [`ravedude`]:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install ravedude
```

Then instanciate this template:

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template.git
```

You will be prompted to select your board - do so and you're ready to roll!
Everything is prepared so you should be able to just

```bash
cargo run
```

and see a blinky flashed to your board!
